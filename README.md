# Face Mask Detection

## Description  
This project detects whether a person is wearing a face mask using deep learning and computer vision techniques.

## How to Run  
1. **Train the Model:**  
   ```bash
   python train_mask_detector.py
2. Run Face Mask Detection on Video:
   python detect_mask_video.py
3. Dataset:
   You can download the dataset from Kaggle.
